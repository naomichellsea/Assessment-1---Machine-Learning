The slight scatter at the higher end indicates more difficulty predicting peak demand days precisely.\n\n#### **Distribution of Prediction Errors (Residuals)**\nThis histogram shows the frequency of the model's errors (Residuals = Actual - Predicted). \n* **Ideal Outcome:** The distribution should look like a bell curve centered exactly at zero.\n* **Finding:** The distributions showed a centered near 0 in the middle which suggests that the model is unbiased overall, but the distribution shows a slight skew, suggesting that the model tends to underestimate high-demand events a bit more often than it over predicts them.\n\n#### **Top 10 Feature Importances**\nThis bar chart shows the relative contribution of each feature to the Decision Tree's final prediction.\n* **Finding:** **`temp`and **`yr`  are the dominant predictors.

I used a data set containing weather and temporal information which was perfectly suitable since the target (cnt) is a continuous numeric count. The entire dataset has 731 records and 16 features.\n\n#### Preprocessing and Feature Engineering\nThe initial processing was cleaning the data and lessening the data leakage, which signifies when the model accidentally cheats by seeing the answer before it concludes.\nThe 'instant', 'dteday' was removed along with 'casual' and 'registered' columns. This was crucial as they make up the total count (cnt = casual registered). Then, I used One-Hot Encoding to handle my categorical data, such as 'season', 'weekday', and 'weathersit'.\nFinally, the continuous variables like 'temp', 'hum', and'windspeed' were normalized using StandardScaler. This ensures that every feature contributes equally, especially for the Ridge model. Moreover, I split the data 80/20 into training and testing sets to properly check how well the model generalizes.\n\n\n#### Model Implementation and Evaluation\n\nI picked two models that were the best suited for this data, which follows:\n1.  **Decision Tree Regressor:** I chose this model because it fits well by capturing non-linear relationships and usually offers the highest predictive accuracy.\n2.  **Ridge Regression:** This was my reliable linear baseline model. It uses L2 regularization, which helps keep things stable when features might be correlated.\n\nThe models were evaluated using the standard regression metrics: **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**, **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**, and the **R² score**.\n\n| Model | R² Train | R² Test | MAE Test | MSE Test |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| Decision Tree | 0.941 | **0.871** | 473.4 | 425,000 |\n| Ridge Regression | 0.816 | 0.826 | 639.1 | 599,000 |\n\n#### Results and Interpretation\n\nThe **Decision Tree Regressor** significantly outperformed the linear baseline, achieving an $R^2$ score of **0.871** on the test data. This means it approximately explains about **87.1%** of the variability in total daily bike rentals. The Ridge Regression model achieved an $R^2$ of **0.826**, showing an interpretable linear baseline.\n\nInsights:\n1.  **Generalization:** The gap between the Decision Tree's training $R^2$ (0.941) and testing $R^2$ (0.871) suggests tha model has a tendency to **overfit**. I already capped the tree depth at 10 to manage, however it shows how easily this non-linear model can memorize the training data.\n2.  **Feature Importance:** As shown in the visualization, 'temp' and 'year' are the strongest predictors. This reflects the dependence of biking activity when it is in warm weather and the overall growth of the program.\n3.  **Error Analysis:** The error plots **Predicted vs. Actual** shows a high accuracy, centering perfectly around zero, which confirms the model is unbiased. The only slight issue is that the residual distribution is slightly skewed, meaning the model tends to under-predict the data with the absolute highest rental demand.\n\n\nIn conclusion, the **Decision Tree Regressor** offers the highest predictive accuracy, while **Ridge Regression** provides a stable and reliable linear model. \n","metadata":{}}]}
